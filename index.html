                Hello! I am an avid, self-motivated, fast learner with a strong desire to learn; by the time i finish this program, i will
                (temporarily keeping this here) have experience in a wide range of programming, database, and scripting languages. I aspire
                to be a developer at a prestigious high-tech organization in the future. 
                A little bit about myself: <br>
                I was mostly learning biology in school but have since left that in the wake in order to pursue other dreams: becoming a 
                software engineer. I have in total a year of programming knowledge. My main goal in life is to be able to start a family
                and be able to provide an environment for them to be able to flourish and live out their dreams without the worries of money.
                <br>
                I have always been a gamer. I built my first computer when I was 12 and have since been upgrading it in order to stay
                on top of the game in terms of hardware. A good computer has always kept me smiling, as having the latest hardware will
                allow me to both enjoy my leisures, and work without the worries of hardware failure.
